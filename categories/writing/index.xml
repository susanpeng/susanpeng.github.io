      <description>When writing about historical figures or events, we often need to use BC and AD, or BCE and CE. How can you use them correctly?
Firstly, both systems count years from the birth of Jesus Christ, following the Gregorian calendar. AD and CE mean before the birth date of Jesus, and BC and BCE mean after the birth date of Jesus.
BC and AD were used earlier in the year 525 by a Christian monk.</description>

      <description>Great documentation should include contextual content that clarifies why and when users might use a feature or workflow. It should tell the software version, the working or installation environment (Windows, Mac, Linux, the version of the operating system), etc. It should keep the readers on the same page at the very beginning.
Great documentation should be clear and concise and divide information into conceptional, instruction, and reference parts. For the instructional documentation, it is important to organize the content task-centered, following the work procedure.</description>
