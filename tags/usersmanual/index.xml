      <description>Bookshelf Editor User&amp;rsquo;s Manual (https://susanpeng.github.io/docs/helpmanual/index.html)
Usability Testing Report (https://susanpeng.github.io/docs/helpmanualusa/index.html)
I created this User&amp;rsquo;s Mnual as my technical writing course project. I received the Bookshelf Editor program without any documentation. I had to go through the whole program to figure out all functions and operational steps by clicking menu items, buttons and links on the screen. After obtaining a sufficient understanding of the program, I created this User&amp;rsquo;s Manual. It was a great process of learning technical concepts and skills and then converting them into clear and concise content for a general audience.</description>

      <description>This document includes two projects:
  Aegisub Quick Start (https://aegisubquickstart.wordpress.com/)
As an excellent subtitle-adding software, Aegisub has been used intensively in my company&amp;rsquo;s video production team. However, its official tutorial is highly text-intensive with little graphics, so I wrote this Quick Start manual to help beginners start quickly and save time and effort during training. This Quick Start manual has significantly reduced the time and human power when training new team members and also dramatically reduced the learning curve for learners.</description>
