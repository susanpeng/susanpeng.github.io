      <description>A Writing Sample: Build a Static Site with Hugo on GitHub
(https://susanpeng.github.io/post/hugo-how-to/)
I wrote this how-to to record the steps I used to create a static website using Hugo and got it running on GitHub.
To set up the static site, I watched several YouTube videos and checked several articles on Google.
These steps are proven correct so that I can follow them for my following static website setup. That would save me a lot of time searching for information or reading the Hugo manual from the beginning.</description>

      <title>A Writing Sample: Aegisub Quick Start</title>
      <link>https://susanpeng.github.io/post/ws_aegisub_explanation/</link>

      <description>Aegisub Quick Start (https://aegisubquickstart.wordpress.com/)
As an excellent subtitle-adding software, Aegisub has been used intensively in my company&amp;rsquo;s video production team. However, its official tutorial is highly text-intensive with little graphics, so training new team members took lots of time and effort.
My task was to create a Quick Start manual to help beginners start quickly and save time and effort for training.
I started by reading the original online manual; it was difficult to understand (perhaps they didn&amp;rsquo;t have a sufficient budget for documentation).</description>

      <title>Writing Samples: User&#39;s Manual and Usability Testing Report</title>

      <description>Bookshelf Editor User&amp;rsquo;s Manual (https://susanpeng.github.io/docs/helpmanual/index.html)
Usability Testing Report (https://susanpeng.github.io/docs/helpmanualusa/index.html)
I created this User&amp;rsquo;s Mnual as my technical writing course project. I received the Bookshelf Editor program without any documentation. I had to go through the whole program to figure out all functions and operational steps by clicking menu items, buttons and links on the screen. After obtaining a sufficient understanding of the program, I created this User&amp;rsquo;s Manual. It was a great process of learning technical concepts and skills and then converting them into clear and concise content for a general audience.</description>

  Aegisub Quick Start (https://aegisubquickstart.wordpress.com/)
As an excellent subtitle-adding software, Aegisub has been used intensively in my company&amp;rsquo;s video production team. However, its official tutorial is highly text-intensive with little graphics, so I wrote this Quick Start manual to help beginners start quickly and save time and effort during training. This Quick Start manual has significantly reduced the time and human power when training new team members and also dramatically reduced the learning curve for learners.</description>
