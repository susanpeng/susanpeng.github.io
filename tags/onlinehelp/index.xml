      <description>This document includes two projects:
  Aegisub Quick Start (https://aegisubquickstart.wordpress.com/)
As an excellent subtitle-adding software, Aegisub has been used intensively in my company&amp;rsquo;s video production team. However, its official tutorial is highly text-intensive with little graphics, so I wrote this Quick Start manual to help beginners start quickly and save time and effort during training. This Quick Start manual has significantly reduced the time and human power when training new team members and also dramatically reduced the learning curve for learners.</description>
